      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I'm Yuanyuan(苑苑), a girl from China and currently lives in NJ/NYC area. I like coding, cooking, photography, and
   traveling. This is my pet project that I am trying to organize all my hobbies together.I called it picture diary.I use it to practice my coding skill,
   showing the life that I enjoy(mostly coking I guess), and record the journey that I have been to(fun). You are very welcome to join me by registering an account,
   or give me any advice by shooting me an email: <a href="mailto:amyye94@gmail.com">amyye94@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding -- I code in a LAMP stack. PHP is my favorite language since it is dynamic and easy to learn. I am trying to develop
   the project following OOP and the MVC pattern. For now I didn't use any framework, but I will improve it later. So, a lot of ideas is in my mind,
   I am still building it and learning from it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking -- Generally I cook chinese food, pan fries, soups, hotpot, and lots of spicy. I think I have a little fan at home.:)
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photography -- I will bring my Nikon 90D with me if I am going out to some interesting places. I also shoot with my iphone a lot. I like playing with light and color.
   But the major point is, I don't want to miss any beautiful moment in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling -- Traveling is always fun. I've been to lots of places in China and the States.
